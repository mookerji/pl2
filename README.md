# pl2 - RTree test implementation

Pure Python implementation of an RTree, a datastructure for efficient
geospatial indexing. This particular module implements a Hilbert cR-Tree, which
uses Hilbert space-filling curves and k-means clustering to improve dynamic set
operations. The details of this implementation are described in two papers,
*Revisiting R-tree Construction Principles* (Brakatsoulas, et al.), *Hilbert
R-tree: An Improved R-tree Using Fractals* (Kamel and Faloutsos), and *R-trees
Have Grown Everywhere* (Manolopoulos, et al.).

More explanation will appear here as needed (in the meantime, checkout
[R-tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) and [Hilbert
R-Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_R-tree)).
